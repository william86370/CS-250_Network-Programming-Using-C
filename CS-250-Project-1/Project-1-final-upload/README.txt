William Wright 11/26/18Project 1 - 3 Tier Information SystemPrograms involved * Project1client.cThe main class of the client. It gives the user a menu to select different functions that the server will process. * Connectionhelper.cThis is a helper class for project1client, it has the functions in it that allow the communication between the client and the server. It can process information given by the application and encode send receive and decode.* CaesarCipher.cThe encryption for the transport of information over tcp, allows the client and server to encode and decode data sent between them * Project1server.cThis is the server class that handles all of the tcp and udp connection from the client and processes them allowing for response. Currently all aspects of the project are working as intended there is some small issues with buffers and how the client receives data it rarely will display some text from memory when printing responses from the server. I faced many problems while completing this project, when I started I was doing the udp portion of the client and server. The first issue I came across was I didn’t know how to get current time in c, after some resource I found the include statement and all of the code to get and return the current time. After I had that implemented I had to implement a tcp server into the udp server. This is where I came across my first huge problem I didn’t know any way to handle both types of request at the same time. After hours of resource I came across Fork() allowing me to create child processes and complete a tcp connection and also have the udp running at the same time, after implementing the child I started to work on part 2 of the project. After adding the ability and the client to be able to ask the quote of the day started working on the server side to allow response to the client. After trying for many hours I finally got the server to respond to the client. After that I added the encryption between the to programs that was very easy to do. The last problem I had was transferring the data from the child to the parent. Then I learned about pipes and how they worked witch allowed me to send data from the child to the parent and fill the array with the right value.From the Client you have 3 options to pick from 1.) Request the time from the server1.) Request the time in GMTClient sends a UDP packet with a request Server Sends back a UDP packet with the Time 2.) Request the time in LOCALClient sends a UDP packet with a request Server Sends back a UDP packet with the Time2.) Request the Quote Of the Day 	the client sends an encrypted tcp packet asking for qotd	server sends back an encrypted tcp packet with qotd	1.)Like the qotd		the client sends the line and the command to like to server encrypted in tcp	2.)Dislike the qotd      the client sends the line and the command to dislike to server encrypted in tcp	3.)exit to main menu		the client sends the command to exit to server encrypted in tcp 	3.) Request Based on Country IDa. ID to Country code Client sends server encrypted ID and gets back encrypted country codeb. ID to country name Client sends server encrypted ID and gets back encrypted country namec. ID to country continentClient sends server encrypted ID and gets back encrypted country continent
